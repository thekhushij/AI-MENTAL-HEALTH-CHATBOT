## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing  
- Stopword removal  
- Lemmatization  
- Tokenization  
- TF-IDF or Embedding Transformation  

### 2. ML Emotion Classifier
Model predicts user emotion based on input text using:  
- Logistic Regression / SVM  
- Neural Network (if enabled)  
- Scikit-Learn pipelines  

### 3. Intent Classification
Detects:  
- Greeting  
- Motivation request  
- Stress messages  
- General conversation  

### 4. Response Generation
A hybrid of:  
- ML-based predictions  
- Rule-based scripted supportive responses

## 💬 Sample Chat
**User:**  
“I am feeling overwhelmed today.”

**Chatbot:**  
“I’m sorry you’re going through this. Do you want to talk about what’s making you feel overwhelmed?”

**User:**  
“I need motivation.”

**Chatbot:**  
“You’re stronger than you think. Every step forward counts, even the small ones.”
